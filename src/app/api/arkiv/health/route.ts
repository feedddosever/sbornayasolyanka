/**
 * GET /api/arkiv/health — a one-URL answer to "is Arkiv actually connected?"
 *
 * Debugging a serverless deployment through build logs is miserable, so this
 * endpoint reports every Arkiv precondition in one place: RPC reachable, key
 * present, signer address, signer funded, project attribute, and whether a
 * real query returns.
 *
 * SECURITY: it never returns the private key or the access key. The signer
 * ADDRESS is public information and is exactly what you need in order to check
 * funding at hub.arkiv.network, so it is included deliberately. The access key
 * is reported as a boolean and a length, never as a value.

  // and query predicates live in bids.ts / listings.ts, so a build that has one
  // file updated and not the other writes snake_case and queries camelCase.

  // is now visible from this endpoint instead of being invisible.
