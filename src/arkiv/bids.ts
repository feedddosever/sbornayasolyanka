 * ── WHY THIS FILTERS ON AN ATTRIBUTE AND NOT ON `$owner` ─────────────────
 *
 * `$owner` is the wallet that SIGNED the entity. In Factor the signing keys
 * live server-side (best practice #7: never expose private keys), so `$owner`
 * is Factor's own key — not the financier's wallet. That is true however many
 * keys the deployment holds: one key makes it obvious, three keys merely hide
 * it behind a plausible-looking `ownedBy()` call.
 *
 * So the honest identifier for "whose bid is this" is the `financier`
 * attribute, which is exactly why it is an attribute. `ownedBy()` would answer
 * a different question: "which of my server keys wrote this row".
 *
 * Factor is therefore a CUSTODIAL index writer, and that is a real trade-off
 * worth naming rather than dressing up. See `bidsSignedBy` below for the
 * non-custodial version and what it would take.
