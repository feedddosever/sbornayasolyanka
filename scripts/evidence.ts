/**
 * Mission 02 evidence, reproducible on demand.
 *
 * Arkiv's brief asks for "the same query before and after the boundary, with no
 * delete call in between". Rather than filming a countdown, this script uses
 * `.atBlock()` point-in-time historic reads: ONE identical query, executed at
 * two different block heights. The bid is present at the first height and gone
 * at the second, and there is no delete call anywhere in this repository.
 *
 * Run it in front of the Arkiv team at the Saturday sign-off:
 *   npx tsx scripts/evidence.ts
 *
 * Env: ARKIV_FIN1_PK (a GLM-funded Tiramisu key)

/**
 * The query under test. Identical at every block height - only `.atBlock()` moves.
 *
 * The `project` clause is load-bearing HERE IN PARTICULAR, not just good
 * hygiene: this script proves a claim about a COUNT going down. Forty teams
 * share this testnet, so without it another team's bid carrying the same
 * `invoice_id` lands in the same result set, and the before/after numbers stop
 * being about Factor's entity at all. An evidence script that can be polluted
 * by a stranger is not evidence.
 *
 * Attribute names are snake_case because the node rejects uppercase after the
 * first character even though the SDK's validator accepts it. `invoiceId` here
 * would not error - it would just match nothing, quietly reporting 0 -> 0 and
 * an INCONCLUSIVE result for a mechanism that actually works.
